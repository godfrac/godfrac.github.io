                <p style="text-align: right; padding-right: 10px;">Climate change is the result of pollution from substances such as the fumes from burnt fuels and fossil fuels getting trapped in the atmosphere and blocking sun rays from escaping/trapping heat inside of the gases, therefore increasing the temperature of the Earth. This has become a common problem, and many attempts have been made to prevent it, although most either failed or barely did a dent in the damage we have already done. Some measures are being taken, such as reducing the amount of fuels we use, using solar panels, electric cars, and a change of fuels in ships. This will not stop it, but it will hopefully reduce the damage. People are also running campaigns to really get climate change out there and to stop people from littering, as that also ruins the planet. The main thing that causes the temperature to go up is the fact that the gases from the fossil fuels trap heat inside them, which also slowly melts the ice caps.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 10px;">Causes and effects of climate change and other information: <a href="index.html"><i class='arrow down'></i></a></p><br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10px;">Creating power such as electricity, heat, energy and such requires the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas). Deforestation is a problem since when trees are cut down, they release all the carbon they have stored. Transportation such as car, bus, train, plane, ship rely on fossil fuels to operate. Most aspects of farming also releases bad gases for the environment, such as cows that release methane, farming vehicles that use up energy and when fertilizing crops. People living their daily life usually helps to support climate change, most without even knowing it. Examples of this are when you use electricity, what you eat and your waste.</p><br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10px;">The main effects and damages this causes in the environment and to the Earth are heat waves (temperature rising), and other temperature related events, sometimes even causing wildfires, and changing the weather cycle, causing floods and homes to be destroyed. Drought is also becoming a problem in some areas, due to lack of water and high temperature. The ice caps are melting due to the temperature, which causes loss of animals (not just arctic animals, but animals that live in forests and other areas due to the effects on the environment that the Earth is suffering) and their habitat, as well as carbon dioxide building up in the ocean, making the water acidic. A food famine and health risks are also rising, as there are droughts and high temperatures, either completely halting or atleast slowing food production. No food also is a factor of poverty, which is also a problem which global warming is causing. Floods may destroy homes, rendering the owners homeless if they are not able to get another house, also with the heat affecting work of some people, as they work outside.</p><br>
                <p style="padding-left: 10px;">It isn't too late to fix climate change. According to <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/theres-still-time-to-fix-climate-about-11-years">this article</a>, we have about 11 years to fix it. If we don't, there will be some pretty big changes and the world will be unsafe. Some consequences are extreme storms, major flooding, sizzling temperatures and droughts, as well as the ice caps completely melting, resulting in the sea level rising ~70 meters. Some ways you can help to exterminate climate change are to use less energy at home, or in general. For example, turning of light bulbs when they are not needed, leave a window open instead of using the air conditioner, using energy efficient appliances, hanging things to dry rather than using a dryer and using cold water to wash clothes. Instead of using transportation such as cars, use a bicycle or just walk. You can also eat healthier foods, such as fruit or vegetables, which do not need to go through as much processing which uses less power. If you are a travel guru, maybe cut down on plane or ship flights as that burns a significant amount of fossil fuels. Another way is to throw away less food, also reducing the amount of items you buy or to buy refurbished items, repair your broken stuff instead of buying new ones and recycle your things. You can also, if you are planning to get a car, you can get an electric car, as it uses little to no fossil fuels (the only way fossil fuels are used in it are to produce the electricity which you put into your car). The last way is to switch to sustainable sources of energy, such as solar panels or wind power sources.</p>
